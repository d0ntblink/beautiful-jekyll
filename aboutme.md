Hello,

My name is Gary aka d0ntbink an InfoSec enthusiast and privacy advocate.
I will be blogging about free software, my discoveries, and other things that I find interesting from other fellow hackers out there.

feel free to reach out to me on any of my socials below.

### My story

To be honest, I’m having some trouble remembering right now, so why don’t you just take a look at [my faviorite movies list](https://letterboxd.com/d0ntblink/list/my-top-movies-in-no-order/){:target="_blank"} and my spotify playlist and get to know me better.
