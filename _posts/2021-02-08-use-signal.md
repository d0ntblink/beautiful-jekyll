What time is it you ask? its time to ditch WhatsApp and all the other data goblin messaging apps!!

By now everyone should be alerted by Facebooks new policies pushed on all the WhatsApp users. It pretty much says you either agree for us to use your data for targetted ads or dont use our app.

Well, that was a simple enough answer for everyone that cared even a little bit about their privacy.

### WHAT HAPPENED TO WHATSAPP?

The reason why WhatsApp became so popular even before it was acuaired by Facebook, is their simple to use UI and end to end encryption. People liked the fact that the end-to-end encryption provided them privacy while the easy-to-use UI was inviting to the users. Even though Facebook promised it wont use personal information like messages for targetted ads when they bought Whatsapp, their new policies sing another tone.

### SO, WHAT SHOULD USE INSTEAD

Worry not! there is an app exacly like good old times Whatsapp out there that is not destened to have the same path. [Signal](https://signal.org){:target="_blank"} is a open-sourced, donation based, feature rich end to end double encryption messaging apps that can cut your internatinal calls and messaging costs.

### WHY SIGNAL THOUGH THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS

Yes, that is true. There are lots of other apps out that do the exact same and some even offer better security. But you should keep in mind the biggest challenge for changing a messaging platform or social media is if other people use it as well, at the end of the day, thats the whole point, connecting with other people over internet. And because of all the recent [Elon Musk Tweets](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153) Signal has blown up thus making the transition much much easier.

### WILL THEY SELL SIGNAL AFTER I START USING LIKE WHATSAPP?

Short answer is no because it licenssed under AGPLv3.
