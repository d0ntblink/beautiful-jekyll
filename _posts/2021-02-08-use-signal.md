By now everyone should be alerted by Facebooks new policies pushed on all the WhatsApp users. It pretty much says you either agree for us to use your data for targetted ads or dont use our app.

Well that was a simple enough answer for everyone that cared even a little bit about their privacy.

### WHAT HAPPENED TO WHATSAPP?

The reason why WhatsApp became so popular even before it was acuaired by Facebook, is their simple to use UI and end to end encryption. People liked the fact that the end to end encryption provided them privacy while the easy to use UI was inviting to the users. Even though Facebook promised it wont use personal information like messages for targetted ads when they bought Whatsapp, their new policies sing another tone.

### SO WHAT SHOULD USE INSTEAD

Worry not! there is an app exacly like good old times Whatsapp out there that is not destened to have the same path. [Signal](https://signal.org) is a open-sourced, donation based, feature rich end to end double encryption messaging apps that can cut your internatinal calls and messaging costs.
