Well I am not.

**Important Note:** I am not a financial advisor and this is not a guide of where to invest your money. I am simply sharing what I learned investing in low market cap coins.

## How did I 100X my very small investment?

After haddeling with Crypto for the past year or so, in the january of 2020 I decided to invest $150 dollars in a coin just to learn how these things function. 

My meme coin portfolio past 4 months

$150 in Husky token --> $850 Husky Tokne --> $80 Husky Token --> $6000 Husky Token --> $10000 Akita, $5000 Kishu, $5000 Hokk
